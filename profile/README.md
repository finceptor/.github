OpenPad Universe DAO is a community-driven multi-verse foundational layer for decentralized economies & governance, aligned with the open-source culture of Web3, empowering the future of efficient markets and ownership via OpenPad NFT, OpenPad Launchpad, OpenPad DAO, OpenPad Pools, OpenPad Business, OpenPad AI, and OpenPad Metaverse.

OpenPad is founded as a state-of-the-art crypto launchpad but it extends its functionality to public good DeFi protocol, decentralized VC DAO, end-to-end project accelerator & incubator, and capital-efficient yield farming & liquidity mining platform owned and governed by its citizens running on the blockchain.

We welcome every size of investors, projects, community members, and citizens. To enable small-size investors to join OpenPad launches worldwide, there is no strict financial rule (staking, purchasing, etc.) so everyone can invest in highly-vetted OpenPad projects. Learn more.

$OPN is a multi-functional deflationary token as it serves the utility (e.g., guaranteed allocation), membership (e.g., IDOs) and governance (e.g., DAO voting) in the OpenPad ecosystem.

$OPN stakers will be eligible to guaranteed allocations without any tier system, lottery games, first-come-first-serve (FCFS) or minimum staking requirement.

The OpenPad Definition of Openness:
- Enabling everyone to join OpenPad's IDOs with guaranteed allocations
- Opening up democratic decision-making to greater citizen participation and voice in ecosystem via DAO dynamics
- Lowering the barriers of information resources and undistorted facts to the public for use
- Opening the process of socioeconomic crypto revolution to a wider community of OpenPad citizens
